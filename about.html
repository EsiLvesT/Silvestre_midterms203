    <h1>About Pink PopMart</h1>
    <p>Your ultimate destination for creativity, quality, and joy!</p>
  </section>

  <section class="content">
    <h2>History</h2>
    <div class="section">
      <p>Pink PopMart was founded in 2025, born out of a simple but meaningful vision: to create a one-of-a-kind space where creativity and joy collide. The idea began as a passion project by a small but driven team of designers and entrepreneurs who believed in the power of small things to make a big difference. Their mission was to craft a brand that could bring people closer through whimsical, beautifully designed products that spark smiles and create memories.</p>
      <p>The journey started in a modest workshop, where the first products were meticulously hand-designed and crafted with love. Each item was created with an unwavering commitment to quality and a deep understanding of what brings people happiness. Over time, what began as a niche collection of figurines grew into a broader range of offerings, including unique tote bags, gift sets, and limited-edition collectibles. Word of our delightful designs spread quickly, and soon Pink PopMart became a global brand beloved by customers from diverse cultures and walks of life.</p>
      <p>Through perseverance, creativity, and a deep connection with our growing community of customers, we’ve transformed from a small startup to a thriving business. While we have grown significantly since our humble beginnings, our original values remain at the heart of everything we do: spreading happiness, celebrating individuality, and bringing joy to everyday moments. Pink PopMart's evolution is a testament to the power of imagination, hard work, and the belief that little treasures can make life extraordinary.</p>
